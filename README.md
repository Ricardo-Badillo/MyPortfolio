# MyPortfolio
This project was creating a portfolio for yourself to help future employers take a look at your work and get to know you. Make sure that your contact info was on your page and everything was clear and easy to read and follow along in the page. All link should be work, for examply if I click on the link "about me", it would correctly direct you to my "about me" section.
